# Week 9 Day 41

## Humpty Dumpty

### Joyce's Wednesday

**The first bundler feature I was working on has been merged in! yay!** It was the one where I added a better error message letting the user know they donâ€™t have git installed when they try to grab gems from git repositories.

I received suggestions on my second bundler feature. The one where it displays the old gem version if you run bundle update or bundle install.

To display that for all three sources, I had the same repeated code in three different places. I moved the same code in all 3 source files (`git.rb`, `path.rb`, `rubygems.rb`) into 1 file. It was moved to the `source.rb` as a method named `version_message` that all 3 files calls. The Bundler::Source module was converted into a class instead.

    module Bundler
      class Source
        [other code]

        def version_message(spec)
          [your repeated code goes here]
        end

      end
    end

    if installed_specs[spec].any?
     return ["Using #{version_message(spec)}", nil]
    else
     install_message = "Installing #{version_message(spec)}"
    end

Since we changed the Source module into a class, all the Source module in `git.rb`, `path.rb`, `rubygems.rb` need to be changed to Source class. However, I got an error when trying to run bundle update after I made the changes.  

    TypeError: Source is not a module

This error occurred because there were still other files that referenced `module Source` instead of the new `class Source`

Next, worked on getting the locked_gems method in` bundler.rb` to not raise an error if the file does not exist.

### Jen's Wednesday

#### All my tests are broken. Waaah.

I ran `$ rspec spec/bundler/dsl_spec.rb` and received an error `$ expected Bundler::GemfileError, got #<SystemStackError: stack level too deep>` Andre thought that I added an infinite loop somewhere. I tested a few files I had not worked on and realized that ALL the tests were failing. Finally I just reforked the whole project and started from scratch. I added my files again and everything worked. Yay!
