# Week 6 Day 26

## More

### Jen's Tuesday

### Joyce's Tuesday
Today we changed our github workflow to make PRs and create issues on our RGSoCBundler repo first. That way we can make as many issues, comments, commits to our hearts content without disturbing the peace and setting off a bunch of notifications on the Bundler repo. Then, once everything looks good, we git squash our commits. Finally, submit the complete change to the bundler repo.

Ruby convention uses underscores for filenames that are more than one word long.
Changed my partials filename to underscores and updated them on the pages. Git squashed, which we learned about yesterday and submitted the PR to the bundler repo.

Added `bundle help` to the command line reference page and created a page for it. Changed the styling so it displays a link inline with the text rather than as a green button.

Watched and followed along to the Peepcode Rspec video.
