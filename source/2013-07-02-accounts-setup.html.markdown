# Accounts Setup

To get setup as a team we created some accounts.

## [RGSoCBundler@gmail.com](mailto:rgsocbundler@gmail.com)

First things first, we need an email address to link all of other accounts to.
This makes it easy to share a password and still keep our private emails
private. We can also forward emails from this account to each of our accounts.

Second things second, follow us on Twitter! We will have the best tweets and
keep you updated on our progress!

## [github.com/RGSoCBundler](http://github.com/rgsocbundler)

Last things last, all of our code (including this blog!) will be hosted on
GitHub of course! So far we have forked and
[bundler/bundler-site](http://github.com/bundler/bundler-site) &
[bundler/bundler](http://github.com/bundler/bundler)! Jen and Joyce will jump
into Bundler open source work through triaging issues and updating site
documentation and man page documentation.
