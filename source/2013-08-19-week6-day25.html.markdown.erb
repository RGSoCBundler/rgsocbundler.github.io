# Week 6 Day 25

## Monday Merge

### Jen's Monday

#### Get Started Page

Today I consolidated the instructions in the http://bundler.io/v1.3/rationale.html, the "Get started-installing Bundler" directions and the "Simple work Flow" directions. They all repeated but with a few extra tidbits of info. Andre gave me the go ahead to do this on Friday.
I also added the link to the sidebar and added a bit of css styling.
I shortened the index page and added links to the Get Started page.

I was having problems doing a git push origin master I kept getting the error:
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/jendiamond/bundler-site.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

So I checked out git push --help
NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS
       When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used
       to point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a
       fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.

Even though I re-created my branch from the master branch where I had pulled down the new sidebar updates git was not liking the differences between my last commit on the getstarted branch. 

I did a git fetch --all then git push -f origin  This updated all my files correctly.

#### FAQ Page

I re-styled the FAQ page and added a link to the side bar. It is ready to be merged.
