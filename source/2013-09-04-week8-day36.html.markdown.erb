# Week 8 Day 36

## Thinking through Wednesday

### Jen's Wednesday
Met with Jessica at Pivotal Labs. We checked out the issue I am working on about returning a message when the gem name is invalid. We wrote a test for it and realized that my rspec wasn't working with the bundler files. Jessica, then Steve, then Lars tried a bunch of different things to make it work. In the end the only solution was to re-install my computer.

When my computer was re-installed my test passed.

When I was using Middleman earlier I was working in a branch. I signed back into it and I got this message:

    $ git checkout invalid_gemname
      M Rakefile
      M bin/bundle_ruby
      M lib/bundler/templates/Executable
      M spec/bundler/dsl_spec.rb
      Switched to branch 'invalid_gemname'

That's the output of git status; git is showing you that after checking out master there are still uncommited changes to your working copy (one modified file and one deleted file).

Check man git-status:

    M = modified
    A = added
    D = deleted
    R = renamed
    C = copied
    U = updated but unmerged

### Joyce's Wednesday
Worked on displaying the old version of the gem when bundle update gets run. The initial code added and tested with `dbundle update` works to display the old version of the gem. But even if the gem did not update to a newer version, it displays the same version as the old version.

Working on getting the rspec to pass. It isnâ€™t working. There might be a bug?
