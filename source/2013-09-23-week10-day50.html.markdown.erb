# Week 10 Day 50

## Come in Travis

### Joyce's Monday

Looks like the bundle update --all rspec tests pass now according to Travis CI.

So because I changed the format of the message that gets displayed when a user runs bundle update (the previous gem version PR), it broke some other tests. I went to go fix those and get them to pass. Continued to make commits and squash them all together to one commit with a summarized, reworded message.

### Jen's Monday

Catching up on posting in the park. Listening to the birds and watching deer stroll by.
Doing more research on the Rocky Mountain Rocky talks and git.
