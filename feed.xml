&lt;p&gt;Thursday, August 29 2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rebasing--windows-issues"&gt;Rebasing &amp;amp; Windows Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-thursday"&gt;Joyce's Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing that my test fails and passes from yesterday, I changed the include string to what 
the better error message could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;describe "without git installed" do
it "prints a better error message" do

install_gemfile &amp;lt;&amp;lt;-G
  git "#{lib_path('foo-1.0')}", :branch =&amp;gt; "omg" do
    gem 'foo'
  end
G

bundle "update"
expect(out).to include("Git is not installed!")   end end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read some more and got the message to print when bundle update was ran without git installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;raise GitError, "Git is not installed!" if !Bundler.which("git")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue was particularly for Windows when the user tries to bundle install. I had moved to an old Mac to make learning web development easier. Now back to Windows. I then setup my Windows and tested it on my Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-thursday"&gt;Jen's Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the day going through the messages on all the PR I have out. Fixing, squashing, rebasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time reading about and changing the sass files. I was trying to get the footer to do something particular. It didn't work quite right but I think it still looks good. At least now I know more about sass. It does look a lot cleaner than css. I added a lower nav bar that I hope gets approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed the people at the Meetup group how to squash commits. We researched rebasing vs. merging. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/804115/git-rebase-vs-git-merge"&gt;This is the answer I found on Stack Overflow by Rob Di Marco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Version&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merge takes all the changes in one branch and merge them into another branch in one commit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rebase says I want the point at which I branched to move to a new starting point
So when do you use either one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let's say you have created a branch for the purpose of developing 
a single feature. When you want to bring those changes back to master, 
you probably want merge (you don't care about maintaining all of 
the interim commits).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A second scenario would be if you started doing some development and 
then another developer made an unrelated change. You probably want to 
pull and then rebase to base your changes from the current version 
from the repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="recreating-bundler-issue"&gt;Recreating Bundler Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-wednesday"&gt;Jen's Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking at the issue again and I noticed a link at the bottom of the page. It went to and &lt;a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/1915"&gt;older issue.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="bundle-outdated-gives-success-incorrectly"&gt;'bundle outdated' gives success incorrectly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No milestone No one is assigned With bundler-1.2.0.pre installed, I run "bundle outdated gemname-with-typo" — misleadingly it reports success, I think because my bundle is technically up-to-date, since is not actually a gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/........
Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/..

Outdated gems included in the bundle:
Your bundle is up to date
An error message like "gemname-with-typo not found" instead would be greatly clarifying.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id="re-creating-the-error"&gt;Re-creating the Error&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;adelcambre's suggested that I make a directory with a Gemfile and run bundle outdated and see what happens when you specify a gem in the Gemfile, vs one that isn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="andys-test-looked-like-this"&gt;Andy's test looked like this:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir test_outdated
$ cd test_outdated
$ vi Gemfile
$ bundle
  Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
  Resolving dependencies...
  Using rake (10.1.0)
  Using bundler (1.3.5)
  Your bundle is complete!
  Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
$ bundle outdated rake
  Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
  Resolving dependencies...

  Your bundle is up to date!
  ... **He notes**: One gem in the gemfile (rake), bundle outdated rake and bundle outdated rails look exactly the same even though rake is there and rails isn't
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id="my-test-looked-like-this"&gt;My test looked like this:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran $ bundle outdated serv to check the error because there is no serv gem listed in the Gemfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ bundle outdated serv
  Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/……….
  Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
  Resolving dependencies…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your bundle is up to date!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ bundle outdated rake
  You have requested:
  rake = 10.0.4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bundle currently has rake locked at 10.1.0.
  Try running &lt;code&gt;bundle update rake&lt;/code&gt;
So yes it worked, I re-created the error or in this case the lack there of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a break to deal with my land-lord and my broken sink and leaking toilet. I returned to find that Jessica had made comments on all my pull requests so I started doing 8 corrections then squashed them all. I am feeling pretty comfortable with squashing and rebasing now. This time when everything went awry on one of the squashings I was able to figure out how to fix it on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-wednesday"&gt;Joyce's Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brushed up on my Ruby by watching &lt;a href="http://ruby-kickstart.com/"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I setup Rspec test for the bundler feature I am adding. I am adding a better error message if the user is trying to update the gems from git, but they don’t have git installed on their computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/local/Cellar/rbenv/0.4.0/libexec/rbenv: line 6: head: command not found

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote my test based on &lt;a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/spec/update/git_spec.rb#L5-L22"&gt;this example spec&lt;/a&gt;. I got the test to pass if I “removed” git from my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;describe "without git installed" do
  it "prints a better error message" do

&lt;h2 id="bundler-features-phase-1"&gt;Bundler Features Phase 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tuesday-aug-28th"&gt;Tuesday Aug 28th&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-tuesday"&gt;Joyce's Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay! The report a bug page pulled in from the issues.md of the bundler repo got merged!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewed material on Gemfile, Rake, setting up alias, the bundler directory, thor in preparation on adding a bundler feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on adding/fixing a bundler feature, got my system to reproduce the error by “removing” git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-tuesday"&gt;Jen's Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id="more-improvements-and-prs-pull-requests"&gt;More Improvements and PRs (pull requests)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on some more improvements to the &lt;a href="http://bundler.io/"&gt;bundler.io site&lt;/a&gt;
I combined 3 things onto a new page called workflow instead of doing a get-sarted page.
+ 1. The top blurb.(the part under Bundler's Purpose and Rationale)
+ 2. A Simple Bundler Workflow from rationale page
+ 3. recommended workflow" at http://bundler.io/v1.3/bundle_update.htm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deleted two sections off of the index page; the block of links called Learn About and the block of links called Use Bundler with. They were all duplicated in the sidebar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a new footer with links similar to what used to be at the top of the Bundler page; buttons for Get Started, Report a Bug, See What's New, Read Documentation, Discuss and Contribute and I added Bundler Workflow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also added the blurb from the rationale page to the top of the index page because it describes what Bundler does in more depth. Now there is nothing left on the rationale page that is not duplicated in other places once all my pull requests are excepted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved the Devswag image and text to the sidebar and made some improvements to the text. So buying a Bundler t-shirt and stickers will hopefully be more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bundler-features"&gt;bundler-features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joyce and I both started on a bundler-feature that had a small tag on it. Andre helped pick one for each of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="bundle-outdated-should-return-non-zero-success-code-for-invalid-gem-name"&gt;bundle outdated should return non-zero success code for invalid gem name&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andre said that the code to check if the gem name is valid is something like:
    if Bundler.definifion.specs.search(gemname).empty?
    # not a valid gem name, you should raise a Bundler::GemNotFound error 
    with a message like "#{gemname} isn't a gem in your bundle, so it can't be updated"
    end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked if I should I change this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if gems.empty? &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sources.empty?
    # We're doing a full update
    definition = Bundler.definition(true)
  else
    definition = Bundler.definition(:gems =&amp;gt; gems, :sources =&amp;gt; sources)
end
options["local"] ? definition.resolve_with_cache! : definition.resolve_remotely!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andre replied: oh hmm I guess I was wrong. You will probably need to rescue the error that is raised by that code
if the gem doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="looking-for-the-files"&gt;Looking for the files&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;$ grep -f "outdated" .&lt;/code&gt; I found all the file that outdated is used in.
    CHANGELOG
    man/bundle.ronn
    lib/bundler/man/bundle.txt
    lib/bundler/man/bundle
    lib/bundler/runtime.rb
    lib/bundler/cli.rb
    spec/other/platform_spec.rb
    spec/other/outdated_spec.rb
————————————-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="trying-to-re-create-the-error"&gt;Trying to re-create the error&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a file based on the file in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-features/issues/6"&gt;bundler-features issue 6.&lt;/a&gt;
It states that the following code should exit 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash

set -ex

mkdir -p /tmp/bf-issue-6
cd /tmp/bf-issue-6

cat &amp;gt; Gemfile &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
source "https://rubygems.org"
EOF

bundle
! bundle outdated blurgh || (echo "failed" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the file on my desktop, named it zero and ran it. This is what I saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;**$ chmod +x zero
$ ./zero
+ mkdir -p /tmp/bf-issue-6
+ cd /tmp/bf-issue-6
+ cat
+ bundle

+ echo failed
failed
+ exit 1

$ echo $?
1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed the exit code to 0 and ran it again. This is what I saw. The command &lt;code&gt;$ echo $?&lt;/code&gt; shows what the last program exited as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ./zero
+ mkdir -p /tmp/bf-issue-6

&lt;h2 id="not-rationale-bug-n-rake"&gt;Not Rationale Bug n' Rake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-monday"&gt;Jen's Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke up parts of the rationale page and combined them into other pages instead of adding them on the get started page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;per Andre's requests:
Grouping - The section about "groups" should be merged with the page that is linked as "Grouping" in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up&lt;/strong&gt; - The section about "set up your application to use bundler" should be merged with the Bundler.setup page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing&lt;/strong&gt; - The "check your code into version control" and "share your application with other developers" should be put into a new page named "Sharing" and linked in the sidebar Usage section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updating Gem&lt;/strong&gt; - The "updating a dependency" and "updating a gem without modifying the gemfile" sections should be put into a new page named "Updating gems" and linked in the sidebar in the Usage section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploying&lt;/strong&gt; - The "deploying your application" section should be merged with the existing "deploying" page that is linked in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-monday"&gt;Joyce's Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Report a bug page is generated from the issues.md file placed in the source directory. The bug is the markdown file does not render to html correctly. The number &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; shows up to the right of the Bundler logo and makes the logo link not clickable. This is weird. We spent time trying to fix the &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;. Andre realized that &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; is the id of nil and then found that the markdown file can’t render &lt;code&gt;link_to&lt;/code&gt; with blocks. He fixed it in the layout.haml. Now I don’t need to put the issues.md in a partial to have the page render correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;:issues&lt;/code&gt; task was included before the &lt;code&gt;:build&lt;/code&gt; task that way it gets a copy of the latest issues.md file before deploying. Also, the source/issues.md was added to &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; so that the build artifacts from the bundler repo is not in the bundler-site repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report a bug page generated from the ISSUES.md of the bundler repo was squashed and submitted the PR to bundler repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started reading about some more &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html"&gt;git commands&lt;/a&gt;: git clean, git reset&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jen-friday"&gt;Jen' Friday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about Rspec and spent the rest of day wrapping up the FAQ page. I worked on doing my first commit squash and I ran into problem after problem with git which Andre walked me through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the basic commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git checkout master 

$ git pull upstream master 

$ git checkout faqpage 

$ git rebase -i master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/master.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change the word "pick" to "s"&lt;/strong&gt; Then run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git push -f origin faqpage
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/jendiamond/6325286#file-gistfile1-md"&gt;and here's a link to the rest of the directions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-friday"&gt;Joyce's Friday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Received suggestions on how to improve the Rake task to build the issues page and made changes to it. There was a 4 to the right of the Bundler logo, which makes the the logo unclickable. I don’t know where it is coming from. I created a partial to embed it to another page and the 4 disappeared. shrugs. The page looks pretty good, except for the code block. :-/ Fixed it in the CSS. Then, updated the “Report a bug” link on the sidebar to this page and moved the partial to the correct directory. Got the code block and inline code style to match with the rest of website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squashed the sidebar button fix for Firefox and submitted PR to bundler site. &lt;strong&gt;The fix has been merged. Yay!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="eastsidewestside-monthly-bash-august"&gt;Eastside/Westside Monthly Bash August&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about Rspec and watched some of the Rspec Peepcode video but mostly I spent my day refining my code and slides for my presentation at the Monthly L.A. Eastside/Westside Ruby Meetup. Our group is a combination of General Assembly students, Rails Girls Summer of Code teams, CS students and their friends. Most of the people attended either a Railsbridge or a Rails Girls event as their launching point into Ruby. This evening's talks were about gems and gem structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="hands-on-presentation---creating-a-gem"&gt;Hands-on Presentation - Creating a Gem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross, from Pivitol, gave a talk about Pivotal Labs and how they work pair programming. The first gem talk by Anna Mendoza explained the structure of gems and how to find good ones to use. My hands-on workshop presentation was based on the gem Joyce and I created several weeks ago. I got all 25 people in the room to create the gem, add Thor and test it successfully. The most satisfying part was going around to each person and helping them to get their gem to work. We have a very well written tutorial now. I might make some more improvements to it for ultra-clarity but everyone tonight followed along very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-thursday"&gt;Joyce's Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made mini minor changes to the PRs I have open. The two PRs are to make the sidebar button when viewed in Firefox look the same as in Chrome and adding &lt;code&gt;bundle help&lt;/code&gt; to command line reference page and also its own page. Then, submitted the &lt;code&gt;bundler help&lt;/code&gt; commands PR to bundler-site repo. The &lt;code&gt;bundler help&lt;/code&gt; PR was merged in! yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished watching tutorial on Chrome Dev tools&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made a “reporting a bug” page from ISSUES.md in the master branch of bundler repo based on the understanding of Rake learned few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
