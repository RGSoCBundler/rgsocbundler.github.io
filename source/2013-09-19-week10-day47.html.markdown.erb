# Week 10 Day 47 [Organizized](http://youtu.be/YP4hYtwGFlI)

I added [GistBox](http://www.gistboxapp.com/) to organize my gists. Now I can sort through my gists so much easier. I had created so many that they were getting unwieldy.

I was working looking at some code in bundler and I noticed a lot of blocks that started with begin and ended with end. They all had several exceptions in them. I researched that and read about it for a while. [begin end](http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/rklemme/003-The_Universe_between_begin_and_end.html)

[Tonight the meetup group I organize met for the monthly meetup.](http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Womens-Ruby-on-Rails-Group/events/137696602/) The theme of the night was "How to Build a Programmer from Scratch." It was a really inspiring evening. Almost the entire summer class from General Assembly attended to watch their class mates do their first public presentation. Machiko Yasuda, Theresa Luu, Emilia Kubo Kirschenbaum & Shana Weitzen all talked about the projects they did in GA and about studying together. They also talked about having algorithm parties, the importance of pairing, talking out your problems and marking your progress with a blog. Giles Bowkett talked about learning Lisp as a way to get a good basis for computer knowledge that isn't going to change. He laid out a path to learning Ruby and Rails.
