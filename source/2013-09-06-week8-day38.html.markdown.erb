# Week 8 Day 38

## Gem Features

### Jen's Friday
I worked on finalizing all my pull requests. Almost all of them were merged including the invalid gemname issue on the actual bundler site. WOOOO!

### Joyce's Friday
Installed ctags to make it easier to navigate/jump between code in a text editor.

Installed the debugger gem, required it in our file, `lib/source/rubygems.rb`, and added the word `debugger` on the line where you want to check out what the code is doing. It is similar to irb. We added it in line 71 of `lib/bundler/source/rubygems.rb`

We looked at where the old version of the gem should be added. For example, the `was (2.3.5)` part of the message should go in the “Using” and the “Installing” messages.

`locked_spec` - references the gemfile gems with the gem in the lockfile.

`locked_spec_version` - stores the gem version from the gemfile.lock if the locked_spec matches

Stored the original message, “Using #{spec.name} (#{spec.version})”, in the variable `using_message`.

We only want to add the old version if the version of the gem is not the same as the one in the gemfile.lock (lockfile)

So, we append the old_version to our “Using” and “Installing” message if that is true.

Had to remove the debugger from our file so Rspec at least runs.

Adding our code, broke the `spec/install/gemspec_spec.rb` and `spec/update/gems_spec.rb` Rspec tests because it can’t find a lockfile?
