&lt;h2 id="more"&gt;More&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-tuesday"&gt;Jen's Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still working on the finer details of the new Get Started Pages and the new FAQ page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We switched our files from the bundler-site repo to the RGSoCBundler/bundler-site so all of our pull requests and commits don't alert the entire Bundler community. I had a hard time figuring out pushing to the new location. Finally I realized that I had to make sure to change the base fork to RGSoCBundler/bundler-site master which is reached by pressing the edit button on the right after pressing the pull request button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working on my presentation of creating a gem. Andre went over my lorem ipsum generator gem to make sure everything was in order. He had a few changes so he sent me a pull request. I was cool looking a a pull request. Now I understand what Andre and Jessica have been looking at and why certain PRs are harder to read than others. Basically you want to make similar changes and send the requests more often so they are easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-tuesday"&gt;Joyce's Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we changed our github workflow to make PRs and create issues on our RGSoCBundler repo first. That way we can make as many issues, comments, commits to our hearts content without disturbing the peace and setting off a bunch of notifications on the Bundler repo. Then, once everything looks good, we git squash our commits. Finally, submit the complete change to the bundler repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby convention uses underscores for filenames that are more than one word long.
Changed my partials filename to underscores and updated them on the pages. Git squashed, which we learned about yesterday and submitted the PR to the bundler repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;bundle help&lt;/code&gt; to the command line reference page and created a page for it. Changed the styling so it displays a link inline with the text rather than as a green button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watched and followed along to the Peepcode Rspec video.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-6-day-25"&gt;Week 6 Day 25&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id="monday-merge"&gt;Monday Merge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-monday"&gt;Jen's Monday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id="get-started-page"&gt;Get Started Page&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I consolidated the instructions in the http://bundler.io/v1.3/rationale.html, the "Get started-installing Bundler" directions and the "Simple work Flow" directions. They all repeated but with a few extra tidbits of info. Andre gave me the go ahead to do this on Friday.
I also added the link to the sidebar and added a bit of css styling.
I shortened the index page and added links to the Get Started page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having problems doing a git push origin master I kept getting the error:
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/jendiamond/bundler-site.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push –help' for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I checked out git push –help
NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS
       When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used
       to point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a
       fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I re-created my branch from the master branch where I had pulled down the new sidebar updates git was not liking the differences between my last commit on the getstarted branch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a git fetch –all then git push -f origin  This updated all my files correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="faq-page"&gt;FAQ Page&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I re-styled the FAQ page and added a link to the side bar. It is ready to be merged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-monday"&gt;Joyce's Monday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay! The sidebar got merged and deployed on the bundler.io website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the sidebar was merged, minor finishing touches were made. I removed extra whitespace and it was also easier to remove the aside html tag because it was not really necessary and we would have to add a shim to implement html5 for older browsers that don’t support it. All that wasn’t worth it for one tag. But, it can be added in the future. The sidebar is a great starting point ready for use and for additional improvements now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deployment though, I realized the sidebar shows up for all versions of the bundler documentation website. That isn’t ideal when the sidebar contains links to version 1.3 of bundler and if you are browsing about version 1.2 of bundler. I made the sidebar only display for version 1.3 of bundler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The update for having the sidebar only for v1.3 was merged!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the What’s New page header links has duplicate code, I changed it to use partials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also learned we can automatically close an issue, if we type “Fixes #57” in the PR(Pull Request) comments. https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learned about git squashing, where if you have a bunch of little commit messages to get rid of all that clutter. Combine it into 1 or fewer commits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-5-day-24"&gt;Week 5 Day 24&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id="whats-up-doc"&gt;What's Up Doc?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-friday"&gt;Jen's Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on breaking apart the Rationale Page to create a FAQ page. I created a new Get Started page and I created a new Bug report page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-friday"&gt;Joyce's Friday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I compared what commands are in the man pages and on the website’s command line reference page. The Bundler commands not listed on the website are &lt;code&gt;bundle help&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bundle list&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;bundle list&lt;/code&gt; does the same thing as &lt;code&gt;bundle show&lt;/code&gt;. I added &lt;code&gt;bundle help&lt;/code&gt; to the command line reference page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed the alignment for the button in the sidebar was off so I made it have even whitespace between the left and right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the What’s New page, the 1.0 and 1.1 point release buttons link directly to the 1.0 and 1.1 versions of the changelog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="man-pages-and-rake"&gt;Man Pages and Rake&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that the &lt;a href="http://bundler.io/v1.3/man/bundle.1.html"&gt;Bundler html man pages&lt;/a&gt; were generated with a Rubygem called &lt;a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/ronn"&gt;Ronn&lt;/a&gt;. The html man pages get generated with this command in the bundler repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ronn --html man/bundle.ronn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a rakefile was created so if we run &lt;code&gt;rake man&lt;/code&gt;, it goes and runs the above command. Then, moves the generated html man pages in the bundler repo into the man directory in our bundler-site repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the bundler-site repo doesn't have a man directory and wondered where the Bundler html man pages were being pulled from. I initially thought the Bundler website was being generated from the bundler-site repo, but with Andre's explanation, it actually is on the gh-pages branch in the bundler repo. We are actually making edits/changes on the bunder-site repo, which then goes to bundler repo on the gh-pages branch where the website is served from. The above steps and creation of the man pages are accomplished with code in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site/blob/master/Rakefile"&gt;Rakefile&lt;/a&gt; where if we run &lt;code&gt;rake release&lt;/code&gt; on the command line, it means the release task will run update_vendor, then build, then man, then release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is similar to how our &lt;a href="http://rgsocbundler.github.io"&gt;rgsocbundler.github.io&lt;/a&gt; website is setup, except it is only on one repo. The website gets edited on the source branch and then &lt;code&gt;rake publish&lt;/code&gt; to go live on the master branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages"&gt;How we are allowed to host a website on github.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="whats-new--bug-report"&gt;What's New &amp;amp; Bug Report&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica was Doing Team Building with her G5 team today so Joyce and I worked remotely today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-thursday"&gt;Jen's Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked out of the Starbucks in Atwater Village today. I saw several kids practicing their dance moves outside while waiting for a bus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started by creating some issues for some changes I want to make to the Bundler site. Like a create an FAQ page, create a footer and create a Report a Bug page. Then Jessica pointed out that Andre already had posted a Create a Report a Bug issuesn so I decided to work on that first.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had pulled Joyce's remote to my master branch yesterday so I could view her new sidebar. I was creating my branches with the side bar included until I realized that it was a bad idea so I rolled back and re-created all my branches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created a "Report a Bug" page based on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/ISSUES.md"&gt;ISSUES.md page&lt;/a&gt; I am still getting used to using HAML. White space delimiters are tricky. I sent a pull request for this page so I can get comments on it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made some comments on the Sidebar pull request Joyce made. I suggested aligning the text left instead of right.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed a link to the bundler-features repo on the issues page. I found the directions to be really unclear in the README. I suggested to Andre that we change it. So he re-wrote it and then I made some more changes to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-features"&gt;README file.&lt;/a&gt; I am excited to see that commit merged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-thursday"&gt;Joyce's Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a pull request merged because I didn’t push all my commits right away. Next time I should commit everything before opening a pull request. Or should I?! Since, this turned out to be a nice side effect to a mistake. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above merged pull request was actually part of this one to fix open issue 53. I created a new pull request where I added the current What’s New page with buttons and links to new pages for the other Bundler version releases and also linked to the changelog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sidebar was looking uneven and not congruent with the entire page so I made changes to the sass file to make it look nicer and cleaner. I made adjustments to the stylesheet so the whitespace between the left and right side of the page where even, the space between the content and the sidebar where even, the top of the sidebar and the first header was also lined up. Also removed the underline from the sidebar header, made the sidebar header size smaller, and aligned it to the right. The sidebar has turned out looking great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="haml-haml"&gt;Haml Haml&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="haml"&gt;Haml&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned about &lt;a href="http://haml.info/tutorial.html"&gt;Haml&lt;/a&gt; because the Bundler website uses Haml. It can be used instead of ERB and can be converted from an ERB template to Haml. With less syntax, Haml is easier to read and looks clean, some people say it reads like a Haiku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sidebar was organized and filled with links, which hopefully, makes the website easier to navigate and find what you are looking for. The styling of the sidebar was made to match the current look of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a lot of ideas about changes to the Bundler website to make it better. So, we started with making some changes to the homepage and created a Get Started page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added each other's remote repo to our local repo. That way we can better preview the changes each of us made. (For beginners, don't include the angled brackets)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote add &amp;lt;your_nickname&amp;gt; &amp;lt;the_remote_url_link&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pull down the remote repo to our local repo. We used the same command, but with the &lt;code&gt;nickname&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git fetch &amp;lt;your_nickname&amp;gt;

git merge &amp;lt;your_nickname/the_branch_name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accidentally added the remote to the wrong repo. To remove a remote repo,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote rm &amp;lt;your_nickname&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bundler-site"&gt;Bundler Site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-hub"&gt;The Hub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Team Bundler worked in Downtown L.A. at the &lt;a href="http://www.thehubla.com/"&gt;Hub&lt;/a&gt; with the whole G5 crew including Jessicard who is visiting from San Francisco. We worked on the documentation for the &lt;a href="http://bundler.io/"&gt;Bundler&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bundler-site-1"&gt;Bundler Site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen worked on organizing the content and all the links for the new side bar. We are ready to get rolling and start making changes. Soon we hope it will be much better. There is so much information already there it just needs some organizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each section will have its own page, Jen found some great information that was buried. The side bar alone will really help make it easier to get around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked to improve the documentation for Bundler. Before our trip to the Distill Conference, we had analyzed the website to see what can be better organized and be more user friendly. We browsed through the issues created for the bunder site. The first issue we focused on was making a sidebar for the website. It got confusing between all the syntax; Markdown, Haml, SASS, CSS, and ERB. We got a skeleton of a navigation sidebar on the right side of the page locally and started a pull request for the first piece in creating the sidebar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="no-jobshttpwwwimdbcomtitlett2357129-"&gt;No &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2357129/"&gt;jOBs&lt;/a&gt; :(&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working we all went to try to see the premier of the Steve Jobs movie. We all had printed out our tickets and signed up on the website. We thought all we had to do was stand in line and we'd see it. Little did we know that there was a good chance we wouldn't get in. We stood on the sidewalk collecting friends, Ashley, Anna, Chris, Jessica Suttles, Jessicard, and Shane Becker. After 2 hour of the line slowly surge towards the red carpet we realized that we were 20 people away from getting in. Boo.&lt;/p&gt;
