# Week 8 Day 35

## We Have Issues

### Joyce's Tuesday

Learned to set the path to blank for rspec test, that way it can’t find 
git. Before, I manually “removed” git to get the test to pass.

Wrote the rspec test based on spec/update/ directory and separated into 
3 files based on if the gem source is from rubygems, git, or path. 
I haven’t gotten the rspec to pass yet though.

Andre gave the method to display the old gem version, which I added 
in to the lib/bundler/source/rubygems.rb.

### Jen's Tuesday

It seemed like a Monday because of the Labor holiday. I re-did all my 
pull requests from scratch so they would contain only the changes I 
made with the changes from the pull upstream master. I was getting 
confused that the FAQ page kept coming back into the branches that 
I was working on. I thought that maybe I had made the other branches 
from the FAQ branch. 

This is what was actually happening: even though it has not been 
published the FAQ page has been merged into the master repo so when 
I did a `git pull -i upstream master` the FAQ page is included into my 
files and that it supposed to be happening and it is not supposed to be deleted.

After fixing all the PRs I started another issue in the bundler-feature area. #6
