# Week 6 Day 28

## Improving Doc

### Jen's Thursday

### Joyce's Thursday
Made mini minor changes to the PRs I have open. The two PRs are to make the sidebar button when viewed in Firefox look the same as in Chrome and adding `bundle help` to command line reference page and also its own page. Then, submitted the `bundler help` commands PR to bundler-site repo. The `bundler help` PR was merged in! yay!

Finished watching tutorial on Chrome Dev tools

Made a “reporting a bug” page from ISSUES.md in the master branch of bundler repo based on the understanding of Rake learned few days ago.
