<img src="https://bundler.campfirenow.com/room/566068/uploads/4699656/GitHub-Diagram.png" />

#### Fork the Repo (original repo) you want to work on to your Github account repo
    Press the Fork button (which is on Github.com)

https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo

Explanation: It creates a copy of the Repo to your account.

#### Clone the Repo on your Github account to local
    git clone https://github.com/RGSoCBundler/rgsocbundler.github.io.git

#### Link the original repo to your local repo so you can pull the latest updates and make sure your copy is in sync with the original repo
    cd rgsocbundler.github.io
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/RGSoCBundler/rgsocbundler.github.io.git

#### Create Feature Branch
    git checkout -b branch-name

    (example: git checkout -b pull-cheatsheet)

(The git checkout -b command automatically switches to the branch)

#### Check that you are on the correct branch. Make sure there is an asterik next to the branch name.
    git branch

#### Make Your Changes/Fixes/Features and commit it to origin (the repo on your github account)
    git add .
    git commit -m "write what changes you made"
    git push origin pull-cheatsheet

#### Send a Pull Request - from origin to upstream (your account repo to the original repo)
    Click Compare & pull request or the Green button on your Github repository
