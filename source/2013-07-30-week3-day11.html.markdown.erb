# Week 3 Day 11

## It's Hammertime
We are talking about the Rubygem [Thor](http://whatisthor.com/), of course.

### What We Did
Thor is a [RubyGem](http://rubygems.org/gems/thor) that is used to replace rake, sake, and rubigen. However, that is not how Bundler uses it.

We focused on the Command Line Interface (CLI) aspect of Thor.

Yesterday, we created a new gem by following the kind of dated [RailsCast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/245-new-gem-with-bundler)

Today, we added Thor to our gem to build a command-line interface by reading [What is Thor](http://whatisthor.com/) and [Building your tools with Thor](http://blog.paracode.com/2012/05/17/building-your-tools-with-thor/)

For example, we would be creating a command to run our gem like `rails new` would create a Rails app or running `bundle install` would install the rubygems you need to run your app.

### What We Learned from our Boo Booâ€™s?

#### How to Run Your Unpublished Gem
With help from our mentor, Andre Arko, there are 3 ways to run it.

+ `ruby -I lib bin/yourgemname`

+ `bundle exec bin/yourgemname`

+ `bundle exec yourgemname`

Joyce couldn't get `bundle exec bin/yourgemname` to work because the `bin/yourgemname` file was missing the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env ruby` at the very top of the file.

For the last command, we couldn't get `bundle excec lorem` to work and we don't know why.
