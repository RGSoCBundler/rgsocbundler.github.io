# Week 8 Day 36

## Thinking through Wednesday

### Jen's Wednesday

### Joyce's Wednesday
Worked on displaying the old version of the gem when bundle update gets run. The initial code added and tested with `dbundle update` works to display the old version of the gem. But even if the gem did not update to a newer version, it displays the same version as the old version.

Working on getting the rspec to pass. It isnâ€™t working. There might be a bug?
