  <h2>RGSoC LA Bundler Team</h2>
  <p>RGSoC is all about helping women contribute to open source projects. Open
  source software takes a lot of online communication. To get as much practice as
  possible we will open source our communication!</p>

  <p>All summer we will be posting all of our #tools, #goals, #progress, and #achievements
  to this blog so others can learn from what we have learned!</p>

    <h3>Jen Diamond</h3>
    <h4>Student</h4>
    <p>I was working on an animation for a planetarium dome when I learned some Ruby so I could complete my idea. That's when I realized that programming was the missing link to my future. I started taking more programming classes and attended Railsbridge.<p>

    <h3>Joyce Hsu</h3>
    <h4>Student</h4>
    <p>Hello I'm Joyce! Driven by curiousity, I've dabbled in HTML and CSS here and there. I attended RailsGirls LA and have developed a strong interest in learning Ruby and Rails. When not learning to code, I like to listen to/discover new music and love animals.</p>
