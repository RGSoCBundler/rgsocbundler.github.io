# Week 5 Day 23

## What's New & Bug Report

Jessica was Doing Team Building with her G5 team today so Joyce and I worked remotely today.

### Jen's Thursday

I worked out of the Starbucks in Atwater Village today. I saw several kids practicing their dance moves outside while waiting for a bus. 

+ I started by creating some issues for some changes I want to make to the Bundler site. Like a create an FAQ page, create a footer and create a Report a Bug page. Then Jessica pointed out that Andre already had posted a Create a Report a Bug issuesn so I decided to work on that first.

+ I had pulled Joyce's remote to my master branch yesterday so I could view her new sidebar. I was creating my branches with the side bar included until I realized that it was a bad idea so I rolled back and re-created all my branches.

+ I created a "Report a Bug" page based on the [ISSUES.md page](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/ISSUES.md) I am still getting used to using HAML. White space delimiters are tricky. I sent a pull request for this page so I can get comments on it.

+ I made some comments on the Sidebar pull request Joyce made. I suggested aligning the text left instead of right.

+ I noticed a link to the bundler-features repo on the issues page. I found the directions to be really unclear in the README. I suggested to Andre that we change it. So he re-wrote it and then I made some more changes to the [README file.](https://github.com/bundler/bundler-features) I am excited to see that commit merged.

### Joyce's Thursday

I had a pull request merged because I didn’t push all my commits right away. Next time I should commit everything before opening a pull request. Or should I?! Since, this turned out to be a nice side effect to a mistake. Hooray!

The above merged pull request was actually part of this one to fix open issue 53. I created a new pull request where I added the current What’s New page with buttons and links to new pages for the other Bundler version releases and also linked to the changelog.

The sidebar was looking uneven and not congruent with the entire page so I made changes to the sass file to make it look nicer and cleaner. I made adjustments to the stylesheet so the whitespace between the left and right side of the page where even, the space between the content and the sidebar where even, the top of the sidebar and the first header was also lined up. Also removed the underline from the sidebar header, made the sidebar header size smaller, and aligned it to the right. The sidebar has turned out looking great!
