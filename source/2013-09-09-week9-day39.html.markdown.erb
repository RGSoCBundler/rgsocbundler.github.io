# Week 9 Day 39

## Fixer Uppers

### Joyce's Monday

I received comments on my first Bundler feature pull request. My first Bundler 
feature pull request was on printing a better error message to let the user know 
that they need to install Git if they are trying to grab the gems from git repositories.

I removed some unnecessary blank lines and changed the error message to be more 
useful. Updated rspec test to create a git repository and updated the test to 
match the more useful error message in git_proxy.rb.

I also reviewed what I had worked on on Friday and what was git merge vs. rebase.

### Jen's Monday

**`$ echo $?`** gives you the exit code of the last command that was run

**`$ :w !ruby -c`** check your ruby code in gvim to make sure it is all good ruby

When I get use this code in `lib/bundler/dsl.rb` line78

    # duplication of same exact gem, same version too 
      if gem(name, *args)
        gemfile <<-G
          gem 'rails', '~> 4.0.0'
          gem 'rails', '~> 4.0.0'
          G
          raise GemfileError, "Gem #{name.to_s} is duplicated in your Gemfile. Please delete one."
      end

I get this error
