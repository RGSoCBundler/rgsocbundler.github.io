# Week 3 Day 12

## Due Diligence - Bundle Gem & Thor CLI

### What We Did

+ More Thor. We created our cheatsheets for [Creating a Gem](http://rgsocbundler.github.io/cheatsheets/create_gem.html) and [Using Thor to Add CLI.](http://rgsocbundler.github.io/cheatsheets/adding-cli-to-a-gem-using-thor.html) We fixed the Thor files so it actually prints Lorem Ipsum instead of the Thor hello name message from the tutorial.

+ We found out that we get to attend the [Distill Conference](https://distill.engineyard.com/) next week. This is perfect because Jessica will be speaking there and we will get to meet our mentor Andre in person. We are gearing up to give a lightning talk on Creating a Gem & Using Thor to Add CLI.

+ Joyce played [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) and played with options and flags in our Thor files.

+ Read about [binstubs.](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/wiki/Understanding-binstubs)

+ Today we worked at [The Farmhouse](http://farmhouse.la/) and got to have lunch with Shane. It is so pleasant working here with Civ the dog wandering around and the 100 year old Avocado tree in the back yard.

### Resources We Used

  + [#201 Bundler (revised) ☆](http://railscasts.com/episodes/201-bundler-revised)

    Bundler makes it easy to manage Ruby Gem dependencies. Learn how to use it in a Rails application, see what's new in Bundler 1.1, convenient ways to run bundle exec, and how to fix gem compilation issues.

  + [#245 New Gem with Bundler ☆](http://railscasts.com/episodes/245-new-gem-with-bundler)

    Creating new gems is easy with the `bundle gem` command. In this episode I will walk you through how this works.

  + [What is Thor](http://whatisthor.com/)

  + [Building Your Tools with Thor](http://blog.paracode.com/2012/05/17/building-your-tools-with-thor/)

  + [What is an executable?](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/executable_file.html)

  + [RubyGems.org - Make Your Own Gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/)

  + [Bundler gemspecs](http://bundler.io/v1.3/rubygems.html) Using Bundler with Rubygem gemspecs

  + [Bundler - Gemfile](http://bundler.io/v1.3/gemfile.html) Read the manual for an in-depth discussion of all of the options available in the Gemfile and how to use them.


### What We Learned from our Boo Boo’s?

Jen's advice about your .bashrc - Do not name a shortcut named "gem" in your bashfile or any other keyword that would be used in the commandline. It will take hours off your life. ;)
