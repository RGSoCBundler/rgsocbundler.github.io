&lt;h2 id="not-rationale-bug-n-rake"&gt;Not Rationale Bug n' Rake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-monday"&gt;Jen's Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke up parts of the rationale page and combined them into other pages instead of adding them on the get started page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;per Andre's requests:
Grouping - The section about "groups" should be merged with the page that is linked as "Grouping" in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up&lt;/strong&gt; - The section about "set up your application to use bundler" should be merged with the Bundler.setup page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing&lt;/strong&gt; - The "check your code into version control" and "share your application with other developers" should be put into a new page named "Sharing" and linked in the sidebar Usage section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updating Gem&lt;/strong&gt; - The "updating a dependency" and "updating a gem without modifying the gemfile" sections should be put into a new page named "Updating gems" and linked in the sidebar in the Usage section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploying&lt;/strong&gt; - The "deploying your application" section should be merged with the existing "deploying" page that is linked in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-monday"&gt;Joyce's Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Report a bug page is generated from the issues.md file placed in the source directory. The bug is the markdown file does not render to html correctly. The number &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; shows up to the right of the Bundler logo and makes the logo link not clickable. This is weird. We spent time trying to fix the &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;. Andre realized that &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; is the id of nil and then found that the markdown file can’t render &lt;code&gt;link_to&lt;/code&gt; with blocks. He fixed it in the layout.haml. Now I don’t need to put the issues.md in a partial to have the page render correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;:issues&lt;/code&gt; task was included before the &lt;code&gt;:build&lt;/code&gt; task that way it gets a copy of the latest issues.md file before deploying. Also, the source/issues.md was added to &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; so that the build artifacts from the bundler repo is not in the bundler-site repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report a bug page generated from the ISSUES.md of the bundler repo was squashed and submitted the PR to bundler repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started reading about some more &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html"&gt;git commands&lt;/a&gt;: git clean, git reset&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="partially-squish-squashed"&gt;Partially Squish Squashed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jen-friday"&gt;Jen' Friday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about Rspec and spent the rest of day wrapping up the FAQ page. I worked on doing my first commit squash and I ran into problem after problem with git which Andre walked me through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the basic commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git checkout master 

$ git pull upstream master 

$ git checkout faqpage 

$ git rebase -i master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/master.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change the word "pick" to "s"&lt;/strong&gt; Then run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git push -f origin faqpage
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/jendiamond/6325286#file-gistfile1-md"&gt;and here's a link to the rest of the directions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-friday"&gt;Joyce's Friday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Received suggestions on how to improve the Rake task to build the issues page and made changes to it. There was a 4 to the right of the Bundler logo, which makes the the logo unclickable. I don’t know where it is coming from. I created a partial to embed it to another page and the 4 disappeared. shrugs. The page looks pretty good, except for the code block. :-/ Fixed it in the CSS. Then, updated the “Report a bug” link on the sidebar to this page and moved the partial to the correct directory. Got the code block and inline code style to match with the rest of website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squashed the sidebar button fix for Firefox and submitted PR to bundler site. &lt;strong&gt;The fix has been merged. Yay!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="improving-doc--gem-presentation"&gt;Improving Doc &amp;amp; Gem Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-thursday"&gt;Jen's Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id="eastsidewestside-monthly-bash-august"&gt;Eastside/Westside Monthly Bash August&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about Rspec and watched some of the Rspec Peepcode video but mostly I spent my day refining my code and slides for my presentation at the Monthly L.A. Eastside/Westside Ruby Meetup. Our group is a combination of General Assembly students, Rails Girls Summer of Code teams, CS students and their friends. Most of the people attended either a Railsbridge or a Rails Girls event as their launching point into Ruby. This evening's talks were about gems and gem structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="hands-on-presentation---creating-a-gem"&gt;Hands-on Presentation - Creating a Gem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross, from Pivitol, gave a talk about Pivotal Labs and how they work pair programming. The first gem talk by Anna Mendoza explained the structure of gems and how to find good ones to use. My hands-on workshop presentation was based on the gem Joyce and I created several weeks ago. I got all 25 people in the room to create the gem, add Thor and test it successfully. The most satisfying part was going around to each person and helping them to get their gem to work. We have a very well written tutorial now. I might make some more improvements to it for ultra-clarity but everyone tonight followed along very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-thursday"&gt;Joyce's Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made mini minor changes to the PRs I have open. The two PRs are to make the sidebar button when viewed in Firefox look the same as in Chrome and adding &lt;code&gt;bundle help&lt;/code&gt; to command line reference page and also its own page. Then, submitted the &lt;code&gt;bundler help&lt;/code&gt; commands PR to bundler-site repo. The &lt;code&gt;bundler help&lt;/code&gt; PR was merged in! yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished watching tutorial on Chrome Dev tools&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made a “reporting a bug” page from ISSUES.md in the master branch of bundler repo based on the understanding of Rake learned few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rspec"&gt;Rspec&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-wednesday"&gt;Joyce's Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The What’s New in each Release header links was merged to the bundler repo. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Received suggestions on how to improve the link for the bundle help page. Made changes so that all of the text link was in the green button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was previewing the above, I noticed the "View All Commands" button in the sidebar did not have left or right padding when viewed in Firefox. :( Chrome and Firefox doesn’t really display the same things. I added padding to at least even out the button. Then, wanted to center the Firefox button. That’s when I realized Firefox doesn’t automatically add the width size while Chrome does! I only had to add a width size and they both look the same now. No padding was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rakeroutes.com/blog/deliberate-git/"&gt;Read about writing better git commits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;write in present tense and as a command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explain what the code change does and why the change is necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished watching last bit of Rspec video&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started watching tutorial on Chrome Dev tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-wednesday"&gt;Jen's Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watched the Peepcode video about Rspec and worked on the Get Started and FAQ pages of the Bundler site. There are problems viewing the pull requests because the text isn't wrapping. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://slid.es/jendiamond/createa_gem"&gt;Worked on my slides and code for my presentation a bit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="more"&gt;More&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-tuesday"&gt;Jen's Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still working on the finer details of the new Get Started Pages and the new FAQ page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We switched our files from the bundler-site repo to the RGSoCBundler/bundler-site so all of our pull requests and commits don't alert the entire Bundler community. I had a hard time figuring out pushing to the new location. Finally I realized that I had to make sure to change the base fork to RGSoCBundler/bundler-site master which is reached by pressing the edit button on the right after pressing the pull request button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working on my presentation of creating a gem. Andre went over my lorem ipsum generator gem to make sure everything was in order. He had a few changes so he sent me a pull request. I was cool looking a a pull request. Now I understand what Andre and Jessica have been looking at and why certain PRs are harder to read than others. Basically you want to make similar changes and send the requests more often so they are easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-tuesday"&gt;Joyce's Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we changed our github workflow to make PRs and create issues on our RGSoCBundler repo first. That way we can make as many issues, comments, commits to our hearts content without disturbing the peace and setting off a bunch of notifications on the Bundler repo. Then, once everything looks good, we git squash our commits. Finally, submit the complete change to the bundler repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby convention uses underscores for filenames that are more than one word long.
Changed my partials filename to underscores and updated them on the pages. Git squashed, which we learned about yesterday and submitted the PR to the bundler repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;bundle help&lt;/code&gt; to the command line reference page and created a page for it. Changed the styling so it displays a link inline with the text rather than as a green button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watched and followed along to the Peepcode Rspec video.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-6-day-25"&gt;Week 6 Day 25&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id="monday-merge"&gt;Monday Merge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jens-monday"&gt;Jen's Monday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id="get-started-page"&gt;Get Started Page&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I consolidated the instructions in the http://bundler.io/v1.3/rationale.html, the "Get started-installing Bundler" directions and the "Simple work Flow" directions. They all repeated but with a few extra tidbits of info. Andre gave me the go ahead to do this on Friday.
I also added the link to the sidebar and added a bit of css styling.
I shortened the index page and added links to the Get Started page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having problems doing a git push origin master I kept getting the error:
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/jendiamond/bundler-site.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push –help' for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I checked out git push –help
NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS
       When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used
       to point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a
       fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I re-created my branch from the master branch where I had pulled down the new sidebar updates git was not liking the differences between my last commit on the getstarted branch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a git fetch –all then git push -f origin  This updated all my files correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="faq-page"&gt;FAQ Page&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I re-styled the FAQ page and added a link to the side bar. It is ready to be merged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joyces-monday"&gt;Joyce's Monday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay! The sidebar got merged and deployed on the bundler.io website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the sidebar was merged, minor finishing touches were made. I removed extra whitespace and it was also easier to remove the aside html tag because it was not really necessary and we would have to add a shim to implement html5 for older browsers that don’t support it. All that wasn’t worth it for one tag. But, it can be added in the future. The sidebar is a great starting point ready for use and for additional improvements now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deployment though, I realized the sidebar shows up for all versions of the bundler documentation website. That isn’t ideal when the sidebar contains links to version 1.3 of bundler and if you are browsing about version 1.2 of bundler. I made the sidebar only display for version 1.3 of bundler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The update for having the sidebar only for v1.3 was merged!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the What’s New page header links has duplicate code, I changed it to use partials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also learned we can automatically close an issue, if we type “Fixes #57” in the PR(Pull Request) comments. https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learned about git squashing, where if you have a bunch of little commit messages to get rid of all that clutter. Combine it into 1 or fewer commits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
