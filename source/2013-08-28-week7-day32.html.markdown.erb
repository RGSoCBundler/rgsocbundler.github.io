# Week 7 Day 32

## Recreating Bundler Issue

### Jen's Wednesday

### Joyce's Wednesday
I brushed up on my Ruby by watching [videos](http://ruby-kickstart.com/).

I setup Rspec test for the bundler feature I am adding. I am adding a better error message if the user is trying to update the gems from git, but they don’t have git installed on their computer.

I wrote my test based on [this example spec](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/spec/update/git_spec.rb#L5-L22). I got the test to pass if I “removed” git from my computer.
