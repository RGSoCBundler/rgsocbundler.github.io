# Week 5 Day 24

## What's Up Doc?

### Jen's Friday

### Joyce's Friday

Today I compared what commands are in the man pages and on the website’s command line reference page. The Bundler commands not listed on the website are `bundle help` and `bundle list`. `bundle list` does the same thing as `bundle show`. I added `bundle help` to the command line reference page.

I noticed the alignment for the button in the sidebar was off so I made it have even whitespace between the left and right side.

For the What’s New page, the 1.0 and 1.1 point release buttons link directly to the 1.0 and 1.1 versions of the changelog.

#### Man Pages and Rake

I learned that the [Bundler html man pages](http://bundler.io/v1.3/man/bundle.1.html) were generated with a Rubygem called [Ronn](http://rubygems.org/gems/ronn). The html man pages get generated with this command in the bundler repo:

    ronn --html man/bundle.ronn

However, a rakefile was created so if we run `rake man`, it goes and gets it from the bundler repo and makes the man directory and html pages in our bundler-site repo.

I noticed that the bundler-site repo doesn't have a man directory and wondered where the pages were being pulled from. I initially thought the Bundler website was being generated from the bundler-site repo, but with Andre's explanation, it actually is on the gh-pages branch in the bundler repo. We are actually making edits/changes on the bunder-site repo, which then goes to bundler repo on the gh-pages branch where the website is served from. The above steps and creation of the man pages are accomplished with code in the [Rakefile](https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site/blob/master/Rakefile) where if we run `rake release` on the command line, it means the release task will run update_vendor, then build, then man, then release.

It is similar to how our [rgsocbundler.github.io](http://rgsocbundler.github.io) website is setup, except it is only on one repo. The website gets edited on the source branch and then `rake publish` to go live on the master branch.
