### Adding CLI to Your Gem using Thor
Our example gem is called lorem. Replace lorem with your gem directory name accordingly.

**1. Go into your Gem directory**

`cd lorem`

**2. Create the cli.rb in `lib/lorem`**

`touch lib/lorem/cli.rb`

**3. In the cli.rb file, create a class that inherits from Thor**

    require "thor"

    class CLI < Thor
      desc "ipsum", "Lorem text generator"
      def ipsum
        puts "Lorem Ipsum blah blah blah"
      end
    end

**4. Create bin folder**

`mkdir bin`

**5. Create executable file naming it your gem command**

`touch bin/lorem`

**6. Add this into your `bin/lorem` file**

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    require 'lorem/cli'

    CLI.start

**7. In lorem.gemspec, add this before `end`**

    spec.add_runtime_dependency "thor"

### How to Run Your Unpublished Gem
There are 3 possible ways to run it.

+ `ruby -I lib bin/gem_command_name`

+ `bundle exec bin/gem_command_name`

    If you get a `bundler: not executable: bin/gem_command_name` error, run `chmod +x bin/gem_command_name`

+ `bundle exec gem_command_name`

    We currently haven't figured out why the last command doesn't work.
