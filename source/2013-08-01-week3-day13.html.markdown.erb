# Week 3 Day 11

## Namespace n Rspec

### What We Did
We fixed our gem to have namespace in the `lib/loremz/cli.rb`. Namespace is where the class CLI is encapsulated by module Loremz. The syntax for namespacing is `Loremz::CLI`

    module Loremz
      class CLI < Thor
        #your methods
      end
    end

That way our `lib/loremz/cli.rb` file matches with the `lib/loremz.rb`

**Why do we want our `lib/loremz/cli.rb` and `lib/loremz.rb` file to match?**

The `lib/loremz/cli.rb` file is just for handling what comes in the command line. While the content would be stored in the `lib/loremz.rb`

We use `lib/loremz/cli.rb` to call `lib/loremz.rb`

Today we also worked on writing RSpec tests for the gem we created.

### What We Learned from our Boo Boos?
Joyce's ipsum command didn't work because the `require "loremz"` in `lib/loremz/cli.rb` was left out. We need to include it to load the file `lib/loremz.rb`
