# Week 4 Day 16

## Documentation

Today we started working on improving the documentation on the [Bundler website.](http://bundler.io/) We all agree that the site needs better navigation.

### Jen's Tuesday 

I went through every page of the Bundler site testing buttons, links and identifing problems with the structuring of the information. I found a 404 error buried in the site. [My notes.](https://gist.github.com/jendiamond/6169493#file-gistfile1-md) I also fixed the slide presentation for our possible talk at Distill tomorrow. I really hope that happens.

### Joyce' Tuesday

I went through the google analytics of the Bundler site and gave recommendations and suggestion based on my findings.
Looks like the first button people click on is **Learn More: Gemfile** I wonder if others did the same. I initially browsed right past **Would you like to: Get started, Report a bug, See what's new, Read documentation.**

### Distill

We are both really excited for our first Ruby Conference in San Francisco tomorrow at [Distill.](http://distill.engineyard.com/) We get to watch Jessic give her talk and a bunch of other really interesting speakers. We also get to meet our mentor Andre in person. Oh yeah, Andre is going to send us/ bring us? Bundler shirts!
