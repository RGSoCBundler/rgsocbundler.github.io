## Partially Squish Squashed

### Jen' Friday

I read about Rspec and spent the rest of day wrapping up the FAQ page. I worked on doing my first commit squash and I ran into problem after problem with git which Andre walked me through.

These are the basic commands:

    $ git checkout master 

    $ git pull upstream master 

    $ git checkout faqpage 

    $ git rebase -i master

Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/master.  

**Change the word "pick" to "s"** Then run:

    $ git push -f origin faqpage

[and here's a link to the rest of the directions.](https://gist.github.com/jendiamond/6325286#file-gistfile1-md)

### Joyce's Friday

Received suggestions on how to improve the Rake task to build the issues page and made changes to it. There was a 4 to the right of the Bundler logo, which makes the the logo unclickable. I don’t know where it is coming from. I created a partial to embed it to another page and the 4 disappeared. shrugs. The page looks pretty good, except for the code block. :-/ Fixed it in the CSS. Then, updated the “Report a bug” link on the sidebar to this page and moved the partial to the correct directory. Got the code block and inline code style to match with the rest of website.

Squashed the sidebar button fix for Firefox and submitted PR to bundler site. **The fix has been merged. Yay!**
