# Week 4 Day 16 Documentation

Today we started working on improving the documentation on the [Bundler website.](http://bundler.io/) We all agree that the site needs better navigation. 

## Jen's Friday 

I went through every page of the Bundler site testing buttons, links and identifing problems with the structuring of the information. I found a [404 error.](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md) [My notes.](https://gist.github.com/jendiamond/6169493#file-gistfile1-md) I also fixed the slide presentation for our possible talk at Distill tomorrow. I really hope that happens. 

## Joyce' Friday

I went through the google analytics of the Bundler site and gave recommendations and suggestion based on my findings. 
Looks like the first button people click on is **Learn More: Gemfile**
Wonder if others did the same, but I initially browsed past **Would you like to: Get started, Report a bug, See what's new, Read documentation.**

---------------------------------------------------

>>We are both really excited for our first Ruby Conference in San Francisco tomorrow at [Distill.](http://distill.engineyard.com/) We get to watch Jessica and a bunch of other speakers and we get to meet our mentor Andre in person. Oh yea, Andre is going to send us/ bring us? Bundler shirts!
