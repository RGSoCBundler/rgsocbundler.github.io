# Week 10 Day 47

## begin end bundle update

### Joyce's Thurday

Worked on editing our post for the main RGSoC blog.

I received word to tweak what the message displays when someone runs bundle 
update and then to squash my commits and send the PR to the 2-0-dev branch. 
However, before that, I realized the message should also let the user know 
how to update a specific gem like bundle update <gem_name>. Although, I was 
suppose to submit my PR...the Travis CI build test didnâ€™t pass. I went and 
fixed all the bundle update failures in the spec directory, made commits 
as I went along.

### Jen's Thursday

I added [GistBox](http://www.gistboxapp.com/) to organize my gists. Now I can sort 
through my gists so much easier. I had created so many that they were getting unwieldy.

I was working looking at some code in bundler and I noticed a lot of blocks that started 
with begin and ended with end. They all had several exceptions in them. I researched that 
and read about it for a while. [begin end](http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/rklemme/003-The_Universe_between_begin_and_end.html)

[Tonight the meetup group I organize met for the monthly meetup.](http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Womens-Ruby-on-Rails-Group/events/137696602/) The theme of the night was "How to Build a Programmer from Scratch." 
It was a really inspiring evening. Almost the entire summer class from General Assembly
 attended to watch their class mates do their first public presentation. Machiko Yasuda, 
Theresa Luu, Emilia Kubo Kirschenbaum & Shana Weitzen all talked about the projects they 
did in GA and about studying together. They also talked about having algorithm parties, the 
importance of pairing, talking out your problems and marking your progress with a blog. 
Giles Bowkett talked about learning Lisp as a way to get a good basis for computer knowledge 
that isn't going to change. He laid out a path to learning Ruby and Rails.
