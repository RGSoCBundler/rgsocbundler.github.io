# Week 2 Day 5

## First Pull Request to Bundler!!!

### What We Did
* Reviewed how to make changes by branching and making pull requests
* Troubleshooted what happened when files seemed to disappear, or why we couldn’t push our files.
* Setup Bundler for development
* Wrote documentation on How to Setup Bundler for Development
* Submitted a Pull Request for our documentation on How to Setup Bundler for development
* Received comments from Bundler core team
* Made updates to the documentation and resubmitted with the updates

### What We Learned from our Boo Boo’s?
* We learned if you are going to create new branches, make sure you are on the master branch! Or else, you will end up creating branches within another branch.
* Make sure your remote is pulling upstream from the github repo you forked not from your own github repo. 
* The command to show the remotes
    
    `git remote -v`

* Merge conflict - have to update our local repository to have the same content as the remote repository on github.com. Use git fetch and git merge OR git pull
