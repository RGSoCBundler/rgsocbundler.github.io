# Week 10 Day 44

## Testing & Committing

### Jen's Monday
My new test for the warning that you have multiple gems. I forgot that you have to run the command in the test so it will see the error. That is what `bundle :install` is doing in there.

    describe "#gem" do
        it "will display a Warning if the gem is duplicated" do
          gemfile <<-G
          gem 'rails', '~> 4.0.0'
          gem 'rails', '~> 4.0.0'
          G

          bundle :install
          expect(out).to include("You specified:")
        end
    end

### Joyce's Monday
I worked on writing better [commit messages](http://rakeroutes.com/blog/deliberate-git/) by reading and watching about `git rebase -i` and editing [a pull request](https://github.com/RGSoCBundler/bundler/pull/6) I have open. Previously, I had learned about squashing commits. Now, I worked on writing shorter messages and adding the issues link on the second line by using the reword command when typing the `git rebase -i [commit's hash].

Also read about WIP commits while coding, which I will have to keep in mind now.
