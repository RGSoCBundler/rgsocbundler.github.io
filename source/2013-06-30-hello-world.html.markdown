# Hello World


Hello, from the Rails Girls Summer of Code Bundler Team! 15 July 2013 marks the start of the summer for our team and we are already so excited.

## Open Source Communication

RGSoC is all about helping women contribute to open source projects. Open source software takes a lot of online communication. To get as much practice as possible we will open source our communication!

All summer we will be posting all of our #tools, #goals, #progress, and #achievements to this blog so others can learn from what we have learned!

Each of our posts will serve as a living document that will be updated when we learn more about a subject. The documents are immutable, but copies can be made.
